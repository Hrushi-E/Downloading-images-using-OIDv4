# Downloading-images-using-OIDv4

It is simple repo i used to download images using oidv4 image downloader.

It contains the image_downlaoder.ipynb which contains code and some instructions how I used to download to my own project. It contains lot of redundency code and I just played around the code a bit and tested around

I used other python files to modify the annotation files suited for yolov3 and for other changes.


It is just for vague reference. If time permits I will simplify it further.
